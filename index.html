  <h1>Zsu Karap</h1>
  <h2 id="my-title">Life-long learner</h2

<p>I love learning new things, forgetting old things, losing my things on the metro, and completely and utterly lose track of time on a daily basis in exchange for new knowledge in java and python.</p>
<p>I also love gaming, and want to one day create my own rpg. One hell of a goal, I know, but root for me! </p>
